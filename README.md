# SDCard-SPI-Verification-Using-SystemVerilog
A SystemVerilog verification project that models an SPI master and a behavioral SD card to simulate and validate SD card initialization and read/write sequences (CMD0, CMD8, CMD17, CMD24) without hardware. Includes testbenches and simulation scripts to reproduce console outputs and waveforms demonstrating correct command-response and data transfer.
